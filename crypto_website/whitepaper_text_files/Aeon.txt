Motivation

Overview Motivation

Zimbabwe: recent large scale land redistribution
Commercial farmers (hold title deads, own large tracts of land, highly skilled, productive, land reallocated 1999)
Communal farmers (no title deeds, small (secure) areas of land, unskilled, lack credit, few beneficiaries post-1999) Anecdotal evidence:
Commercial farmers facilitate(d) informal access to K (human and physical) by communal farmers Recent land redistribution affected by low access to skills, machinery
RQ(1): did these links exist?
RQ(2): what effect on productivity of their removal

Overview Motivation
Commercial vs Communal
2000 CFU document - national land holding by various groups: (white) commercial farmers: 21% (average size: 1500ha) (black) commercial farmers: 3% (average size: 1500ha) (black) communal farmers: 42% (ave size: 2ha)

Why cotton?

Overview Motivation

Cotton: widely grown cash & insurance crop Grown by 300,000 HHs, income for 25% rural pop
(Some) cotton support structures survived economic decline Mostly grown by small-scale farmers Input credit schemes Extension services (non-government) Purchased at farm gate
Ceteris paribus is more credible for cotton than other agri-industries
Data from largest cotton marketing company

Overview Natural experiment
Natural experiment (difference-in-difference)

Treatment: land redistribution
Identify: productivity network effects
Treated group: communal farmers close to (previously) large scale commercial farmland
Control group: communal farmers further away Treatment
Lack pre-2000 data Solution: some large-scale farmers not targeted for land redistribution Targeted Farmers = f(characteristics important to network effects &/or productivity) Targeted Farmers = f(ethnicity)

Analysis Data
Data - Mashonaland Central and East
Farm level data (2008, 2009) yield, yield quality, basic inputs, ha, seed growers (quality) rich data on assets, detailed inputs (200 farmers)
Soil quality, rainfall Distance to: gins, roads, commercial farms Enumeration level data(25-60 HH)
Income, consumption and expenditure data (1995, 2001) Farmers trained by NGO

Robustness

Analysis Work in progress

Selection bias: today's black farmers vs previous white farmers vs remaining white farmers
Compare productivity of small holder farmers living close by Use rich evidence from sub-group Compare geographic conditions (land quality, road proximity) Compare ICES data
Replicate D-I-D using living conditions
Training experiment (further control on productivity)

Conclusion

Conclusion

The FTLF has been detrimental to productivity of cotton farmers regardless location
Those close to previously commercial land have suffered marginally more than those further away
This result provides evidence that the FTLR may have disrupted externalities important to small-holder (cotton) farming
