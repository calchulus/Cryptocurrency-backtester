1. MONACO CARD EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.1. Core Features

The functionality of Monaco Card makes it a must-have item not only for every Ether or

Bitcoin holder, but also for everyone who spends money in foreign currency.

Core features:

·

Spend your Ether or Bitcoin with a physical Monaco Card, wherever cards are accepted,

both online & offline

Only the exact amount that you spend with your Monaco Card will be incrementally

exchanged from ETH/BTC in real-time when you swipe your card, with rest being securely

stored in your wallet to which only you have access

·

Exchange money at perfect interbank exchange rates using Monaco App

·

Enjoy the same perfect interbank rates whenever you spend on Monaco Card

1.2. The Monaco Card
In order to receive the Monaco Card, our customers need to download Monaco Android / iOS App and go through a simple 3 min onboarding process, including remote KYC. We will issue and send the Monaco Cards to customers free of charge. The physical card can be used both for online and offline purchases at more than 30m merchant locations globally. Every time you spend with the Monaco Card, you will be given perfect interbank exchange rates without markups or fees. In practice that means savings of EUR30-40 on every EUR500 spent, compared to high street banks.
You can fund your account with Ether and Bitcoin, instantly and for free. You can also use fiat currencies, topping up your account by bank transfer or with a debit/credit card. Finally, you can also apply for a credit limit from our App and receive a decision within 48 hours. A top-up credit limit effectively turns the Monaco Debit Card into a credit card, as you will only pay interest on amounts of credit that you use, but don't repay in a timely fashion.
Spending your ETH/BTC with Monaco Card is seamless. You keep ETH/BTC balances in your wallet, which you can view at any time in the Monaco App. Every time you swipe your Monaco Card, we will only exchange the incremental amount of ETH/BTC that is required to settle the fiat currency transaction. The rest of your ETH/BTC balances remain in your wallet. There are no monthly or annual fees for usage of the Monaco Card. Access to perfect inter-bank exchange is free. Monaco will not charge fees for global ATM withdrawals within Fair Usage Limits. There is a 1% fee for all transactions (swipe and exchange) of ETH/BTC. These earnings will accrue in the MCO Smart Contract, the rights to which will be held by community members who hold MCO tokens.

1.2.1. ETH-funded Purchase with Monaco Card Example
Jenny is a using Monaco Card for her travel expenses. She tops-up her Monaco account with 1 ETH. She is in France on holidays and spends EUR 16 on lunch. She swipes the Monaco Card. Monaco Card's server-side processing systems apply perfect interbank exchange rates to calculate that EUR 16 equals USD 17.7410. Based on the current exchange rate between USD and ETH, provided by the highest daily volume exchange, USD 17.7410 is equal to ETH 0.19068368. Monaco will pass on the best-available exchange rate between USD & ETH to the users without any mark-up. Monaco will cover the cost of USD & ETH exchange rate (the maker/taker fees traditionally charged by cryptocurrency exchanges). No fees are applied for exchange between USD & EUR. Users will receive the perfect interbank exchange rate without any mark-up.
This is absolutely the most cost-efficient way to spend ETH in the world, avoiding all the bank fees!
The only fee that is applied is a 1% software license fee that accrues to the MCO Asset Contract described in section 1.5. In this case, ETH 0.001906837 will be automatically credited to MCO Asset Contract, increasing the value backing MCO tokens. Since fees are paid in the token transacted in, the most popular tokens used for transacting will accumulate to the distribution contract, helping back the value of MCO.
3

1.2.2. BTC-funded Purchase with Monaco Card Example
The scenario works exactly as with an ETH-funded purchase described above, the only difference being the Asset Contract accrual of a 1% software license fee. BTC equivalent will be converted to ETH at prevailing rates without any exchange fees and credited to the MCO Asset Contract. Monaco will cover the cost of BTC & ETH exchange (the maker/taker fees traditionally charged by cryptocurrency exchanges). Monaco will pass on the best-available exchange rate between BTC & ETH without any mark-up.
4

1.3. MCO Token Creation
The Monaco MCO Token Creation Event will last for 30 days, starting 9:30am UCT on 18th of May 2017. A fixed number will be created during the sale, and no more will be created thereafter.
1.4. MCO Asset Contract
MCO Asset Contract accrues a 1% licensing fee on transactions using the Monaco Card funded with ETH/BTC, as well as exchange transactions between ETH/BTC and fiat currencies. Over time MCO will be backed by a portfolio of the most popular ERC20 tokens. MCO holders will be able to access the portfolio through a mechanism called "REDEEM & BURN" (see 1.6).
Fees from card swipes will be denominated in the token being used to fund the swipe (ETH or BTC at launch). These fees will be sent directly to the MCO Asset Contract. Over time, this contract will accrue tokens in proportion to the usage of the Monaco Card & App globally.
1.5. Support for other ERC20 currencies
Other broadly accepted cryptocurrencies will be added to the platform over time as they gain popularity and in consultation with the community. The current assumption, in order to maximize potential of the MCO Asset Contract, is to set the integration threshold at a currency-in-circulation market cap of US$500mm.

1.6. MCO Token Redeem and Burn

At any time, a holder of MCO can "Redeem and Burn" the MCO for their pro-rata share of each token held by the MCO Asset Contract. The holder will irrevocably destroy the MCO, and in exchange, the MCO Asset Contract will transfer the underlying tokens to the holder.
MCO token will have a market value at or above the assets contained in the MCO Asset Contract. If the value goes below, market participants will be incentivized to purchase MCO and burn it; this will then push the value of MCO back up.

·

Definitions:

There are MCOT MCO issued.

There are MCOh units of MCO held by a certain holder of MCO.

There are m distinct tokens held in the MCO Asset Contract.

The MCO Asset Contract holds Tm tokens for the m th token contract.

Then the holder of MCO will receive the following vector of tokens upon calling the burn function and choosing to "Redeem and Burn":

·

Received:

MCOh [T1, T2, . . ,Tm]
MCOT

6

1.6.1. Redeem and Burn Example

An MCO holder has 500MCO, the current MCO supply is 10,000MCO. The MCO Asset Contract holds 1,000ETH.

Their claim equals:

[1,000 ETH]

500 10,000

If he burns his MCO, they will receive:
1500,0000= 5.00%
Of the held tokens, giving them:

50ETH

After `burning' his MCO, the remaining supply of MCO will now equal:
10,000 - 500 = 9,500

This means that remaining MCO holders will have a higher claim per MCO on the underlying assets than before the burn. A separate MCO holder who also held 500 MCO will now have a claim on the assets equal to:
500 = 5. 26%
9,500
Since users can always cash out, we expect the value of MCO should be at least the value of the underlying tokens.
Consequently, MCO will typically be worth more than the underlying tokens, because a user who cashes out abandons future fees. By cashing out, the user distributes the present value of future dividends to the other MCO holders. Therefore, users will not normally cash out!

7

2. THE MCO TOKEN CREATION

Monaco Card aims to accept up to 150,000ETH from our initial token partners and create approximately 17.6m MCO for sale in exchange for the ETH committed.
The MCO smart contract will stop accepting commitments at 888,888ETH hard cap. The Token Sale will last for 30 days. If soft-cap is reached, the event will be extended for 7 days and then closed. If hard-cap is reached, the event will close automatically.

2.1. The Monaco BLACK Card

Limited Edition Monaco BLACK Card will be issued to first 999 customers. Each of the cards will have a unique number engraved from 001 to 999 accompanied by the words "Founding Member".
The priority of the numbers will be decided after the MCO Token Creation Event, according to the following rules:

·

001-499 ­ will be assigned to the top ETH token contributors upon completion of MCO

Token Creation Event

·

500-999 ­ will be assigned to the fastest contributors, based on time stamp of their ETH

contribution

There will be no Monaco BLACK Cards issued after the initial 999.
The BLACK Card Leaderboard will be available and updating automatically in real-time during MCO Token Event.
Besides the exclusive design, Monaco BLACK Card holders will enjoy lifetime unlimited perfect interbank exchange rates and triple free monthly ATM withdrawal limits. More benefits will be rolled out over time.
The person who contributes the highest number of tokens in the ICO will be rewarded with Monaco BLACK Card Number 001 and will receive a bonus 188,888 MCO Tokens from the Monaco Founder's Pool. The 188,888 Bonus MCO Tokens will not be subject to a lockup period.

2.2 .Use of Funds

The proceeds from the token sale will fund the product launch, continued platform development and user acquisition:

·

35% ­ R&D and Product Development

Includes opening of an R&D center in Shenzhen with approximately 20-30 engineers.

·

20% ­ Marketing and Customer Acquisition

The marketing budget is not significant compared to the target number of customers we

intend to acquire. The key source of new customers is going to be word-of-mouth, as the

product gives users a very strong commercial incentive to download the App and get the

Monaco Card. There are natural network effects built into the product around the P2P money

sending function, which will lower the average customer acquisition cost (CAC) substantially.

·

15% ­ Initial Capex, including costs of e-Money licenses, compliance and architecture setup

Some of our key partners are listed in section 4 of the document. There is a substantial cost

associated with integrating all those partners, acquiring all the necessary licenses across

multiple jurisdictions, building out compliance teams, legal fees and general technical

architecture setup.

·

30% ­ Working Capital

Our product ­ the first and only Universal Money App - is bridging the gap between the

worlds of crypto and fiat currencies. In order to offer our users real-time access to funds and

perfect exchange rates without mark-up, we will have to bridge funding gaps between

multiple parties using our own balance sheet.

2.3. TokenMarket Escrow

Funds committed during the MCO Token Creation Even will be held in a secure multi-signature wallet and will only be released from the account with 2 out of 3 signatures:

·

Kris Marszalek ­ Founder @ Foris

·

Mikko Ohtamaa ­ CTO @ TokenMarket

·

Timothy Hitchens ­ Head of Solution Architects, Worldwide Public Sector - APJ at

Amazon Web Services

2.4. Reserve Tokens
We are setting aside 30% of all MCO created as Reserve Tokens. These MCO will not be issued or sold during the initial sale and are locked in a smart contract. If at some point it seems advisable for the Monaco Card project to sell more tokens, some or all of these may be offered in an auction format or some other format that suits the capital needs of the project. Specifically, there are substantial balance sheet strength requirements in case Monaco decides to apply for a full banking license in the European Union or Asia. In the interim, these MCO will not be used in any way. They will not be considered as issued for Redeem and Burn calculations. It is possible these MCO will never be issued, however, we feel it is prudent to have some backup if needed. In any event, Monaco will engage directly with MCO holders to seek guidance and market reaction before any of the Reserve tokens are offered.

5. THE MARKET

Fundamentally, there are two broad group of customers for whom Monaco Card has been built

·

Cryptocurrency holders, who want to spend it globally in the most convenient and efficient

manner

·

Fiat-only customers, who spend in foreign currency and are now facing excessive levels of

fees charged by banks

While the funding sources for Monaco Card will differ for both customer groups, their use cases largely overlap and include:

1. Outbound travel spend

IPK International reported that the world outbound travel market turnover for the full year 2016 topped the $2 trillion mark for the first time, which was an increase of around 7 to 8% compared to 2015. The outlook for travel in 2017 is very positive, according to IPK International. The consultancy forecasts an increase in worldwide outbound trips of between 4 and 5%. IPK International sees particularly strong growth for outbound trips from Asia, with a likely rise of 6%. China's outbound tourism is a massive opportunity. Over 70% of cross-border trips are made to Hong Kong and Macau, according to the World Travel Monitor. Chinese outbound trips amounted to around 39 million in 2015, excluding trips to Hong Kong and Macao. For the Chinese traveler holding digital currencies, the Monaco App can be an essential tool.

2. In-bound remittance (sending money back home)

A remittance is - quite simply - a money transfer made by a foreign worker back to an individual in their home country. However, the typical international money transfer requires loads of communication between the individuals on either end of it. They have to calculate exchange rates, synchronize amounts, collect personal details, agree on a transfer method, and then confirm when the cash has been sent and received. Worldwide, 230 million people send $500 billion in remittances each year, primarily using firms like Western Union, Moneygram, and RIA. India, China and the Philippines are the top three countries that receive the most money via remittances. In terms of continents, Asia is the biggest recipient by far - in 2016, migrants from China and India sent home a staggering $180 billion. year, primarily using firms like Western Union, Moneygram, and RIA. India, China and the Philippines are the top three countries which receive the most money via remittances. In terms of continents, Asia is the biggest recipient by far - in 2016, migrants from China and India sent home a staggering $180 billion.

1. Cross-border online shopping in foreign currency The global B2C cross-border e-commerce market will balloon in size to $1 trillion in 2020 from $230 billion in 2014, according to a report from global consulting firm Accenture and AliResearch, Alibaba Group's research arm. In the report, researchers forecast that this increasingly popular form of online shopping--entailing consumers taking to the Internet to buy products directly from overseas retailers--will see compound annual growth of 27.4 percent per year. By 2020, more than 900 million people around the world will be international online shoppers, the report says, with their purchases accounting for nearly 30 percent of all global B2C transactions. China will become the largest cross-border B2C market by 2020, with the transaction volume of imported goods purchased online reaching $245 billion, according to Accenture-AliResearch. The report predicts over 200 million Chinese consumers will be cross-border shopping by 2020. Monaco Card can address those markets directly and globally .

7. FINANCIALS
We have a short operating history and a new business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate with accuracy our prospects and future financial results. Despite the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets, we are offering two scenarios to help those participating in the Token Creation Event to understand different levers and possible outcomes for the project.
Monaco's revenue comes from the fee paid by the merchants (interchange fee, see below). This fee is the same as on other cards and is paid by merchants to the acquiring bank in order to process their payments. Monaco takes a percentage of this fee each time a customer uses their Monaco Card. We assumed in our models the average interchange fee to be around 1.20%. This is not straightforward, there are pages and pages of rates: the interchange fees vary based on whether the card was present or not ­ and on the type of good or service being bought, whether it was a debit or credit card, whether it was a corporate card, whether it was an international transaction and lots of other criteria.
Monaco intends to add additional recurring revenue streams within the next 12-18 months, including subscription fees based on a fair usage policy (i.e.: for cash withdrawals) and introduction of credit line with repayment period between 12 and 60 months. Additionally, we will partner with innovative fintech companies around the world to provide customers with the best savings, investments, credit, and insurance products directly with our App. We intend to be a digital finance platform and share revenues with selected "best of" partners in other major categories (investing, savings, credit & loans, insurance) with an emphasis on blockchain empowered partners.
Conservatively, we have based our average user spend on debit card reports that give an average spend of USD3,500 per year.
Licensing fees are calculated simply as 1% of transaction volume. We have also taken into account growth in users transacting in ERC20 tokens versus fiat currency. We will grow progressively the percentage of ERC20 tokens transactions from 40% to 80% over 5 years.
23

Financial transactions include POS and ATM transactions.
Since January 2017, Ethereum and the Token market have grown at a value-weighted average of about 300,000% annually (or 6.7x per three months). We do not believe this growth rate will continue over the next five years. We have therefore taken a range of growth from 40% to 100% per year as our range for projections. For each scenario, we also assume that the Ethereum economy grows by around 3% (Conservative) and 6% (Optimistic) monthly for the next 5 years. This equates to around a 40% and 100% annual growth in assets backing MCO for the different scenarios respectively.
Below are some rough projections of Monaco performance under two different scenarios over a 5 year period.
7.1. Conservative
In a conservative scenario, we modestly grow our user base and modestly monetize our products. We will operate in a highly competitive space. However, we strengthen our position as the multi-currency platform of choice in the Ethereum community by adding product features valued by the community. We foresee only a modest increase to the rate at which the general public funds payments using digital currencies. and tokens begin to see adoption by the general public, which also boosts our user-base.
